There're lots of online music streaming services such as Spotify, QQ music, NetEase music, etc. Among them, I like
Spotify's fantastic UI design. Thanks to Spotify's developer-friendly APIs, it's easy to deliver a fast Spotify clone
app like the one that I will show you later.

## Tech Frames

- nextjs 12 (middleware, ssr)
- next-auth
- spotify-web-api-node
- tailwind 3
- recoil for global state management

## Features

- SSO via Spotify
- List playlist
- List songs
- Play songs
- Adjust volume
- Go to the next/previous song
- Start or pause a song
- Responsive design

## Basic Flow

After signing in via Spotify OAuth 2 and NextAuth package, we can see playlists you created on the official Spotify
website. Users can choose a playlist and listen to the songs. Spotify Lite supports basic music control like pause and
start, music shift, and volume adjustment. Of course, responsive design is achieved so mobile users can access the
website with a great experience as well.
