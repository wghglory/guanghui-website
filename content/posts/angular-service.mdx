## Angular Providers

<Table
  columns={['Name', 'Description']}
  data={[
    [
      'Class provider',
      'This provider is configured using a class. Dependencies on the service are resolved by an instance of the class, which Angular creates.',
    ],
    [
      'Value provider',
      'This provider is configured using an object, which is used to resolve dependencies on the service.',
    ],
    [
      'Factory provider',
      'This provider is configured using a function. Dependencies on the service are resolved using an object that is created by invoking the function.',
    ],
    [
      'Existing service provider',
      'This provider is configured using the name of another service and allows aliases for services to be created.',
    ],
  ]}
/>

## Inject Token

`logger` is the token. `provide: <token>`.

```ts
{ provide: "logger", useClass: LogService }
```

```ts
@Injectable()
export class DiscountService {
  constructor(@Inject('logger') private logger: LogService) {}
}
```

### Using Opaque Tokens

Why? Avoid token duplicated name.

```ts
import {Injectable, InjectionToken} from '@angular/core';

export const LOG_SERVICE = new InjectionToken('logger');
```

And register like this:

```ts
providers: [{ provide: LOG_SERVICE, useClass: LogService }],
```

Consume the service:

```ts
constructor(@Inject(LOG_SERVICE) private logger: LogService) { }
```

## Class Provider

Use a class as the token.

```ts
providers: [{ provide: LogService, useClass: LogService, multi: false }],
```

When to use?

Suppose we have a logger service, and we'd like to create a SpecialLoggerService, which extends LoggerService.

```ts
import {Injectable, InjectionToken} from '@angular/core';

export const LOG_SERVICE = new InjectionToken('logger');

export enum LogLevel {
  DEBUG,
  INFO,
  ERROR,
}

@Injectable()
export class LogService {
  minimumLevel: LogLevel = LogLevel.INFO;

  logInfoMessage(message: string) {
    this.logMessage(LogLevel.INFO, message);
  }

  logDebugMessage(message: string) {
    this.logMessage(LogLevel.DEBUG, message);
  }

  logErrorMessage(message: string) {
    this.logMessage(LogLevel.ERROR, message);
  }

  logMessage(level: LogLevel, message: string) {
    if (level >= this.minimumLevel) {
      console.log(`Message (${LogLevel[level]}): ${message}`);
    }
  }
}

@Injectable()
export class SpecialLogService extends LogService {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.minimumLevel = LogLevel.DEBUG;
  }
  override logMessage(level: LogLevel, message: string) {
    if (level >= this.minimumLevel) {
      console.log(`Special Message (${LogLevel[level]}): ${message}`);
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
providers: [
  { provide: LOG_SERVICE, useClass: SpecialLogService }
],
```

Now if we inject `LOG_SERVICE`, we will use `SpecialLogService`.

### Resolving a Dependency with Multiple Objects

Register the service with `multi` true:

```ts
providers: [
  { provide: LOG_SERVICE, useClass: LogService, multi: true },
  { provide: LOG_SERVICE, useClass: SpecialLogService, multi: true }
],
```

Consume the service:

> The services are received **as an array** by the constructor.

```ts
export class DiscountService {
  private logger?: LogService;

  constructor(@Inject(LOG_SERVICE) loggers: LogService[]) {
    this.logger = loggers.find((l) => l.minimumLevel == LogLevel.DEBUG);
  }
}
```

## Using the Value Provider

The value provider is used when you want to take responsibility for creating the service objects yourself, rather than
leaving it to the class provider. This can also be useful when services are simple types, such as string or number
values, which can be a useful way of providing access to common configuration settings.

```ts
let logger = new LogService();
logger.minimumLevel = LogLevel.DEBUG;

@NgModule({
  providers: [{provide: LogService, useValue: logger}],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Using the Factory Provider

The factory provider uses a function to create the object required to resolve a dependency.

- provide: token

- deps: specifies an array of provider tokens that will be resolved and passed to the function specified by the
  useFactory property.

- useFactory: specifies the function that will create the service object. The objects produced by resolving the tokens
  specified by the deps property will be passed to the function as arguments. The result returned by the function will
  be used as the service object.

- multi: allow multiple providers to be combined to provide an array of objects that will be used to resolve a
  dependency on the token.

```ts
providers: [{
  provide: LogService,
  useFactory: () => {
    let logger = new LogService();
    logger.minimumLevel = LogLevel.DEBUG;
    return logger;
  }
}],
```

> The real flexibility of this provider comes when the deps property is used, which allows for dependencies to be
> created on other services.

```ts
// log.service.ts
import {Injectable, InjectionToken} from '@angular/core';

export const LOG_SERVICE = new InjectionToken('logger');
export const LOG_LEVEL = new InjectionToken('log_level');

export enum LogLevel {
  DEBUG,
  INFO,
  ERROR,
}
```

```ts
// app.module
import {LogService, LOG_SERVICE, SpecialLogService, LogLevel, LOG_LEVEL} from './log.service';

let logger = new LogService();
logger.minimumLevel = LogLevel.DEBUG;

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    {provide: LOG_LEVEL, useValue: LogLevel.DEBUG},
    {
      provide: LogService,
      deps: [LOG_LEVEL],
      useFactory: (level: LogLevel) => {
        let logger = new LogService();

        logger.minimumLevel = level;
        return logger;
      },
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

1. Whenever injecting `LOG_LEVEL`, it returns `LogLevel.DEBUG` due to useValue.
1. When injecting LogService, it depends on `LOG_LEVEL`, useFactory injects `LogLevel.DEBUG`, so that
   logger.minimumLevel is debug.

## Using the Existing Service Provider

This provider is used to create aliases for services so they can be targeted using more than one token.

```ts
@NgModule({
  providers: [
    {provide: LOG_LEVEL, useValue: LogLevel.DEBUG},
    {provide: 'debugLevel', useExisting: LOG_LEVEL},
    {
      provide: LogService,
      deps: [LOG_LEVEL],
      useFactory: (level: LogLevel) => {
        let logger = new LogService();

        logger.minimumLevel = level;
        return logger;
      },
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The token for the new service is the string `debugLevel`, and it is aliased to the provider with the `LOG_LEVEL` token.
Using either token will result in the dependency being resolved with the same value.

## Using Local Providers

There is a hierarchy of injectors corresponding to the applicationâ€™s tree of components and directives. Each component
and directive can have its own injector, and each injector can be configured with its own set of providers, known as
local providers.

Sometimes we don't want a single root service!

### Creating Local Providers in a Component

- providers: create a provider used to resolve dependencies of view and content children.
- viewProviders: create a provider used to resolve dependencies of view children.

Use this LogService first, if not found, go up until root.

```diff
import {LogService} from './log.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'paProductTable',
  templateUrl: 'productTable.component.html',
+  providers: [LogService],
})
export class ProductTableComponent {}
```

### Controlling Dependency Resolution

- `@Host`: This decorator restricts the search for a provider to the nearest component.
- `@Optional`: This decorator stops Angular from reporting an error if the dependency cannot be resolved.
- `@SkipSelf`: This decorator excludes the providers defined by the component/directive whose dependency is being
  resolved.

#### Restricting the Provider Search

The `@Host` decorator <span class="text-red-600">restricts the search</span> for a suitable provider so that it stops
once the closest component has been reached. The decorator is typically combined with `@Optional`, which prevents
Angular from throwing an exception if a service dependency cannot be resolved.

```ts
export class PaDisplayValueDirective {
  constructor(@Inject(VALUE_SERVICE) @Host() @Optional() serviceValue: string) {
    this.elementContent = serviceValue || 'No Value';
  }
}
```

#### Skipping Self-Defined Providers

By default, the providers defined by a component are used to resolve its dependencies. The `@SkipSelf` decorator can be
applied to constructor arguments to tell Angular to ignore the local providers and start the search at the next level in
the application hierarchy, which means that the local providers will be used only to resolve dependencies for children.

```ts
@Component({
  // won't be used by itself, but TestComponent's children will use it
  viewProviders: [{provide: VALUE_SERVICE, useValue: 'Oranges'}],
})
export class TestComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(VALUE_SERVICE) @SkipSelf() private serviceValue: string) {
    console.log('Service Value: ' + serviceValue);
  }
}
```
