## Introduction

Standalone components, as the new feature introduced in `Angular v14`, **are not part of an NgModule and define their
dependencies (like module imports) directly**. But this doesn't necessarily let us do anything that we couldn't do with
the existing Angular, it just changes some of the architecture.

React, Vue and other frameworks don't have NgModule concept. They can import components and use them directly. Angular
community enables this feature so react developers can get hands-on experience easily.

Let's review angular history.

### SharedModule ðŸ‘´

A SharedModule, as recommended by the
[Angular Coding Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#shared-feature-module), is a single Angular module with
generic components, directives and pipes that are shared between feature modules in your Angular application.

Creating a project global place for all common things, like widgets or pipes to transform values, makes sense. You can
share them between multiple modules and every developer knows where to put new common components.

  The approach also has drawbacks. In general, we want to create small, encapsulated and reusable units. Creating a
  single shared module may get pretty large as the project grows.

### SCAM ðŸ˜„

[There has been a tendency that NgModule includes fewer contents](https://sandroroth.com/blog/angular-shared-scam).
Think about Material UI.

<Quote>
  `Single Angular Component Module`, is the concept of creating Angular Modules with only one component (or directive /
  pipe). This brings a few benefits.
</Quote>

- **Smaller modules**: A SCAM is small and that is what we mostly want: small units of code, like small functions,
  classes - and also modules.
- **Clear responsibility**: You and every other developer in your team will know what that module is responsible for.
- **Clear dependency**: You can easily check where your component is used by checking where your module is imported.

<Quote color="red">
  You don't have to take "single component" literally, neither "single" nor "component". SCAM also applies to directives
  and pipes. And it's **NOT** about exactly one element. A SCAM may have additional components that are only used
  internally, or it may even export multiple components that always belong together (like a component for an accordion
  and a component for an accordion entry). The pattern should bring you benefits and it's not meant to limit you.
</Quote>

#### SCAM in action

We can apply the SCAM pattern for our SharedModule. We create a shared folder and instead of just one module we create
multiple, small, shared modules there. It looks something like this:

```
src/
â””â”€â”€ app/
    â””â”€â”€ shared/
        â”œâ”€â”€ accordion/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ accordion.component.css|html|ts
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ accordion-group.component.css|html|ts
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ accordion.module.ts
        â”œâ”€â”€ button/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ button.component.css|html|ts
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ button.module.ts
        â””â”€â”€ some-transformation/
            â”œâ”€â”€ some-transformation.pipe.ts
            â””â”€â”€ some-transformation.module.ts
```

This example has three shared modules: accordion, button and some-transformation.

#### Tree-shaking and lazy loading

You may ask if the SCAM pattern provides any advantages regarding tree-shaking and lazy loading. The short answer is:
**no**.

The Angular Ivy renderer, will not include unused components even if they are imported and exported in your
SharedModule. In addition, it will move components into lazy loaded chunks even if other components of the same module
are used in your main bundle.

## Standalone components use another standalone component

```ts {9-10}
import {CommonModule} from '@angular/common';
import {Component, Inject, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import {AboutDialogComponent} from '@oss-core/about-dialog/about-dialog.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'berry-navbar',
  templateUrl: './navbar.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./navbar.component.scss'],
  imports: [CommonModule, AboutDialogComponent],
  standalone: true,
})
export class NavbarComponent {}
```

Here `AboutDialogComponent` is another standalone component. So we can import and use another Standalone component in a
standalone component.

## NgModule components use standalone components

```ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [StandaloneComponent]
})
```

## Lazy loading standalone components

```ts {5-9}
const path: Routes = [
  {path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'prefix'},
  {path: 'home', title: 'Home Page', component: HomeComponent},
  {path: 'about', title: 'About Standalone Page', component: AboutStandaloneComponent},
  {
    path: 'lazy-standalone',
    title: 'Lazy Standalone Page',
    loadComponent: () => import('./lazy-standalone.component').then((m) => m.LazyStandaloneComponent),
  },
  {
    path: 'lazy-module',
    title: 'Lazy module Page',
    loadChildren: () => import('./lazy-module/lazy-module.module').then((m) => m.LazyModule),
  },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes), AboutStandaloneComponent],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

## Creating module-less applications

In future, all components may be standalone by default. No `app.module.ts` or `app-routing.module.ts`.

routes.ts:

```ts
export const path: Routes = [
  {path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'prefix'},
  {path: 'home', title: 'Home Page', component: HomeComponent},
  {path: 'about', title: 'About Standalone Page', component: AboutStandaloneComponent},
  {
    path: 'lazy-standalone',
    title: 'Lazy Standalone Page',
    loadComponent: () => import('./lazy-standalone.component').then((m) => m.LazyStandaloneComponent),
  },
  {
    path: 'lazy-module',
    title: 'Lazy module Page',
    loadChildren: () => import('./lazy-module/lazy-module.module').then((m) => m.LazyModule),
  },
];
```

main.ts:

```ts
import {bootstrapApplication} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {routes} from './app/routes';

// 2 params: rootComponent, config
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [importProvidersFrom(RouterModule.forRoot(routes))],
}).catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

Now you probably will find an error about `router-outlet`. Because `app.component.ts` is now a standalone component, so
you can import `RouterModule`.

```diff
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule,
+  RouterModule,
+  ChildStandaloneComponent,
+  FormsModule, // ...any module required for this component
  ],
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

## Lazy loading feature modules in module-less

Assume we have a feature module `admin.module.ts`. How can we use this module's components inside a standalone
component?

```ts
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {CommonModule} from '@angular/common';
import {UsersComponent} from './users/users. component';
import {RouterModule, Routes} from '@angular/router';

const routes: Routes = [{path: '', component: UsersComponent}];

@NgModule({
  declarations: [UsersComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule, RouterModule.forChild(routes)],
})
export class AdminModule {}
```

routes.ts:

```ts
export const path: Routes = [
  {path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'prefix'},
  {path: 'home', title: 'Home Page', component: HomeComponent},
  {path: 'about', title: 'About Standalone Page', component: AboutStandaloneComponent},
  {
    path: 'lazy-standalone',
    title: 'Lazy Standalone Page',
    loadComponent: () => import('./lazy-standalone.component').then((m) => m.LazyStandaloneComponent),
  },
  {
    path: 'admin',
    title: 'Admin',
    loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then((m) => m.AdminModule),
  },
];
```

## Thoughts

### Better than regular modules?

Right now, standalone components don't really reduce any quantity of work. Yes, you don't need the module file anymore,
but now each component needs each of these pieces and in a lot of cases, we're seeing that we have to duplicate things.
We have to import the router module multiple times or the forms module multiple times, rather than just importing it
once inside of the module and having it be available to the component. So right now, standalone components aren't
reducing the quantity of work that we have to do.

### Lower learning curve?

One thing that standalone components may have is a lower learning curve. Modules sometimes are confusing to people that
are new to Angular and learning Angular, so having a application that doesn't have a route module might be slightly
easier for somebody to learn.
