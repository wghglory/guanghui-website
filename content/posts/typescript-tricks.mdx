## Generate type data automatically

Problem: In many cases, we have to work with JSON data received from a third-party API or a backend service that does
not provide type information (and that isn't listed on DefinitelyTyped)

Solution:

Use tools such as [json2ts.com](http://json2ts.com) to generate type data. If using vscode, there's a plugin called
`JSON to TS`.

## Building objects step by step

Very often, we have to retrieve information from multiple different sources before we can build an object.

```ts
export interface Option {
  id: numbers;
  displayOrder?: number;
  text: string;
}

// assume options are from another API
export interface Question {
  id: numbers;
  text: string;
  displayOrder: number;
  options: Option[];
}
```

Below code won't make the compiler happy:

```ts
let myQuestion: Question = {
  id: 1102,
  displayOrder: 1,
  text: 'Which of the following is a prime number',
};
```

We could make the `options` property optional in the `Question` interface, but that would be cheating.

Solution:

use te `Partial` type:

```ts
let myQuestion: Partial<Question> = {
  id: 1102,
  displayOrder: 1,
  text: 'Which of the following is a prime number',
};
```

## Union types instead of enums

Enums aren't incredibly convenient in Typescript compared to other languages:

```ts
enum GamePadInput {
  Up = "Up",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT'
}
```

Enums get compiled into a big monster of javascript, which affects performance.

```js
var GamePadInput;
(function (GamePadInput) {
  GamePadInput['Up'] = 'UP';
  GamePadInput['Down'] = 'DOWN';
  GamePadInput['Left'] = 'LEFT';
  GamePadInput['Right'] = 'RIGHT';
})(GamePadInput | (GamePadInput = {}));
```

On the other hand, union types are shorter and leaner as they don't get compiled into anything - and in that example,
they are just strings:

```ts
export type GamePadInput = 'UP' | 'DOWN' | 'LEFT' | 'RIGHT';
```

And they can be combined to be even more powerful:

```ts
export type AuthAction = LoginSuccessfulAction | LoginErrorAction | LogoutSuccessfulAction;
```

## Nullish coalescing operator (??)

This operator aims to remove such code from our codebase:

```ts
if (value !== null && value !== undefined) {
  a = value;
} else {
  a = 'some default value';
}
```

Instead, since Typescript 3.7, we can do: `a = value ?? 'some default value';`

Smart Javascript developers have been doing this forever as an alternative: `a = value || 'some default value';`

But `0`, `NaN`, and empty strings are falsy values, so if `value === 0` or `value === ''`, the default value would be
assigned to a.

This behavior is fixed by the `??` operator:

```ts
console.log(0 ?? 42); // outputs 0
console.log('' ?? 42); // outputs ""
```
