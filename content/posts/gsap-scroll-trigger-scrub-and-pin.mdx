## Scrub and Pin

View this car moving on a wide screen:

<CodeFrame

  title="CodePen Home ScrollTrigger - car scrub and pin"
/>

- `scrub: true` will scrub the animation between the scroll boundary. But the behavior is so hard for mousewheel.
- `scrub: 1` is more natural. if scrub number increases, the animation lasts longer.
- `pin: true` will pin the car with a stable Y. Otherwise the car will move right and up together. `pin` makes its Y
  unchanged.

## pinSpacing

<CodeFrame
  title="Pinning with Animation"
  src="https://codepen.io/wghglory/embed/qBVKrdL?default-tab=js%2Cresult&editable=true"
/>

- `pinSpacing:true`: space will be added to the page to push content down vertically so that it will perfectly arrive in
  its "normal" position when pinning is de-activated. **Usually it's natural to set pinSpacing as true given scrub:true
  and pin:true**.
- `pinSpacing:false`: content will scroll _behind_ the pinned element.

> Change pinSpacing to true so that the page copy does not scroll behind the pinned animation.

With **pinSpacing:true** (default) the `.pin-spacer` div will add padding to push content below the pinned item down.

Be sure to set pinSpacing to true and false and compare the difference for yourself

### Pin Deep Dive - How does pinning work under the hood?

<CodeFrame
  title="ScrollTrigger Pin Deep Dive 1"

/>

When scrolling between the boundary, `pin:true` will add `position:fixed` to the target.

```diff
<div
  class="pin-spacer"
  style="flex-shrink: 1; display: block; margin: 0px; inset: 400px 1705px -99px 100px; position: absolute; overflow: visible; box-sizing: border-box; width: 100px; height: 100px; padding: 0px;"
>
  <div
    class="box"
    style="transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px); left: 100px; top: 300px; margin: 0px; width: 100px; height: 100px; padding: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 100px; max-height: 100px;
+    position: fixed;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

When scrolling out of the boundary, `position:fixed` is removed, and translate3d() Y will be calculated.

```diff
<div
  class="pin-spacer"
  style="flex-shrink: 1; display: block; margin: 0px; inset: 400px 1705px -99px 100px; position: absolute; overflow: visible; box-sizing: border-box; width: 100px; height: 100px; padding: 0px;"
>
  <div
    class="box"
+    style="transform: translate3d(0px, 300px, 0px);
    inset: 0px auto auto 0px; margin: 0px; width: 100px; height: 100px; padding: 0px;
-    position: fixed;"
  ></div>
</div>
```

- The pinned element `.box` gets immediately wrapped in a `<div class="pin-spacer">` with a **fixed** width/height to
  match. A class of "pin-spacer" is added to that wrapper.

  Think of it like a proxy element that props open the space where the pinned element was in the DOM so that when it
  flips to `position: fixed` things don't collapse.

- When the ScrollTrigger is active (when the scroll position is between the start and end), it sets the pinned element
  to `position: fixed` and positions it with fixed top/left/width/height values...unless the scroller isn't the viewport
  in which case it never uses `position: fixed` because that'd break sub-scrolling, so it uses pure transforms. If
  `pinReparent` is set to `true` (we recommend avoiding that if you can), the pinned element will get reparented to the
  `<body>` and styles will be moved inline to ensure appearance is maintained.

![pinSpacing](/images/posts/pinSpacing.png)

By default, `pinSpacing:true`, **padding will be added to the bottom** (or right for horizontal: true) of the pin-spacer
so that [in most cases] things get pushed further down/right. When the pinned element gets unpinned, the content
below/right will have caught up. So if, for example, the pinned element stays pinned for 300px, there would be padding
of 300px added.

## Pinning car project

Now that we have discussed some of the technical details of **pinning** and **pinSpacing** let's apply it to something a
bit more "real world". Let's use the very beginning example.

[codepen demo](https://codepen.io/wghglory/full/rNYKwVL)

- enable pinning by setting `pin:true`
- view the `.pin-spacer` background color (edit the css)
- set `pinSpacing:false`
- change start and end values in scrollTrigger config object
