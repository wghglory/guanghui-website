## Discriminated unions

Most of the examples we've looked at so far have focused on narrowing single variables with simple types like `string`,
`boolean`, and `number`. While this is common, most of the time in JavaScript we'll be dealing with slightly more
complex structures.

Let's imagine we're trying to encode shapes like circles and squares for some motivation. Circles keep track of their
radiuses and squares keep track of their side lengths. We'll use a field called `kind` to tell which shape we're dealing
with. Here's a first attempt at defining `Shape`.

```ts
interface Shape {
  kind: 'circle' | 'square';
  radius?: number;
  sideLength?: number;
}
```

We can write a `getArea` function that applies the right logic based on if it's dealing with a circle or square. We'll
first try dealing with circles.

```ts
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
  // 'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.
}
```

Under [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) that gives us an error - which is
appropriate since `radius` might not be defined. But what if we perform the appropriate checks on the `kind` property?

```ts
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape.kind === 'circle') {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    // 'shape.radius' is possibly 'undefined'.
  }
}
```

Hmm, TypeScript still doesn't know what to do here. We've hit a point where we know more about our values than the type
checker does. We could try to use a non-null assertion (a `!` after `shape.radius`) to say that `radius` is definitely
present.

```ts
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape.kind === 'circle') {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius! ** 2;
  }
}
```

But this doesn't feel ideal. We had to shout a bit at the type-checker with those non-null assertions (`!`) to convince
it that `shape.radius` was defined, but those assertions are error-prone if we start to move code around. Additionally,
outside of [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) we're able to accidentally
access any of those fields anyway (since optional properties are just assumed to always be present when reading them).
We can definitely do better.

The problem with this encoding of `Shape` is that the type-checker doesn't have any way to know whether or not `radius`
or `sideLength` are present based on the `kind` property. We need to communicate what _we_ know to the type checker.
With that in mind, let's take another swing at defining `Shape`.

```ts
interface Circle {
  kind: 'circle';
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: 'square';
  sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square;
```

Here, we've properly separated `Shape` out into two types with different values for the `kind` property, but `radius`
and `sideLength` are declared as required properties in their respective types.

Let's see what happens here when we try to access the `radius` of a `Shape`.

```ts
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
  // Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Square'.
}
```

Like with our first definition of `Shape`, this is still an error. When `radius` was optional, we got an error (with
[`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) enabled) because TypeScript couldn't tell
whether the property was present. Now that `Shape` is a union, TypeScript is telling us that `shape` might be a
`Square`, and `Square`s don't have `radius` defined on them! Both interpretations are correct, but only the union
encoding of `Shape` will cause an error regardless of how
[`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) is configured.

But what if we tried checking the `kind` property again?

```ts
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  if (shape.kind === 'circle') {
    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    // Good! (parameter) shape: Circle
  }
}
```

That got rid of the error! When every type in a union contains a common property with literal types, TypeScript
considers that to be a _discriminated union_, and can narrow out the members of the union.

In this case, `kind` was that common property (which is what's considered a _discriminant_ property of `Shape`).
Checking whether the `kind` property was `"circle"` got rid of every type in `Shape` that didn't have a `kind` property
with the type `"circle"`. That narrowed `shape` down to the type `Circle`.

The same checking works with `switch` statements as well. Now we can try to write our complete `getArea` without any
pesky `!` non-null assertions.

```ts
function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case 'circle':
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case 'square':
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
  }
}
```

## The `never` type

When narrowing, you can reduce the options of a union to a point where you have removed all possibilities and have
nothing left. In those cases, TypeScript will use a `never` type to represent a state which shouldn't exist.

### Exhaustiveness checking

The `never` type is assignable to every type; however, no type is assignable to `never` (except `never` itself). This
means you can use narrowing and rely on `never` turning up to do exhaustive checking in a switch statement.

For example, adding a `default` to our `getArea` function which tries to assign the shape to `never` will raise when
every possible case has not been handled.

```ts
type Shape = Circle | Square;

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case 'circle':
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case 'square':
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    default:
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
  }
}
```

Adding a new member to the `Shape` union, will cause a TypeScript error:

```ts
interface Triangle {
  kind: 'triangle';
  sideLength: number;
}

type Shape = Circle | Square | Triangle;

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case 'circle':
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case 'square':
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    default:
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      // Type 'Triangle' is not assignable to type 'never'.
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
  }
}
```

## Using type predicates

We've worked with existing JavaScript constructs to handle narrowing so far, however sometimes you want more direct
control over how types change throughout your code.

To define a user-defined type guard, we simply need to define a function whose return type is a _type predicate_:

```ts
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
  return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
```

`pet is Fish` is our type predicate in this example. A predicate takes the form `parameterName is Type`, where
`parameterName` must be the name of a parameter from the current function signature.

Any time `isFish` is called with some variable, TypeScript will _narrow_ that variable to that specific type if the
original type is compatible.

```ts
// Both calls to 'swim' and 'fly' are now okay.
let pet = getSmallPet();

if (isFish(pet)) {
  pet.swim();
} else {
  pet.fly();
}
```

Notice that TypeScript not only knows that `pet` is a `Fish` in the `if` branch; it also knows that in the `else`
branch, you _don't_ have a `Fish`, so you must have a `Bird`.

You may use the type guard `isFish` to filter an array of `Fish | Bird` and obtain an array of `Fish`:

```ts
const zoo: (Fish | Bird)[] = [getSmallPet(), getSmallPet(), getSmallPet()];
const underWater1: Fish[] = zoo.filter(isFish);
// or, equivalently
const underWater2: Fish[] = zoo.filter(isFish) as Fish[];

// The predicate may need repeating for more complex examples
const underWater3: Fish[] = zoo.filter((pet): pet is Fish => {
  if (pet.name === 'sharkey') return false;
  return isFish(pet);
});
```

## Truthiness narrowing

In JavaScript, we can use any expression in conditionals, `&&`, `||`, `if` statements, Boolean negations (`!`), and
more. As an example, `if` statements don't expect their condition to always have the type `boolean`.

In JavaScript, constructs like `if` first “coerce” their conditions to `boolean`s to make sense of them, and then choose
their branches depending on whether the result is `true` or `false`. Values like

- `0`
- `NaN`
- `""` (the empty string)
- `0n` (the `bigint` version of zero)
- `null`
- `undefined`

all coerce to `false`, and other values get coerced `true`. You can always coerce values to `boolean`s by running them
through the `Boolean` function, or by using the shorter double-Boolean negation. (The latter has the advantage that
TypeScript infers a narrow literal boolean type `true`, while inferring the first as type `boolean`.)

```ts
// both of these result in 'true'
Boolean('hello'); // type: boolean, value: true
!!'world'; // type: true,    value: true
```

It's fairly popular to leverage this behavior, especially for guarding against values like `null` or `undefined`. As an
example, let's try using it for our `printAll` function.

```ts
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
  if (strs && typeof strs === 'object') {
    // not null and string[]
    for (const s of strs) {
      console.log(s);
    }
  } else if (typeof strs === 'string') {
    console.log(strs);
  }
}
```

Keep in mind though that truthiness checking on primitives can often be error prone. As an example, consider a different
attempt at writing `printAll`

```ts
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
  // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  //  DON'T DO THIS!
  //   KEEP READING
  // !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  if (strs) {
    if (typeof strs === 'object') {
      for (const s of strs) {
        console.log(s);
      }
    } else if (typeof strs === 'string') {
      console.log(strs);
    }
  }
}
```

We wrapped the entire body of the function in a truthy check, but this has a subtle downside: we may no longer be
handling the empty string case correctly.

TypeScript doesn't hurt us here at all, but this is behavior worth noting if you're less familiar with JavaScript.
TypeScript can often help you catch bugs early on, but if you choose to do _nothing_ with a value, there's only so much
that it can do without being overly prescriptive. If you want, you can make sure you handle situations like these with a
linter.

One last word on narrowing by truthiness is that Boolean negations with `!` filter out from negated branches.

```ts
function multiplyAll(values: number[] | undefined, factor: number): number[] | undefined {
  if (!values) {
    return values;
  } else {
    return values.map((x) => x * factor);
  }
}
```
