## Different Types of Subject

### Subject

Subject is the simplest way to create an object that is both an Observer and an Observable.

<Quote color="red" title="Limitations">
  when a new subscriber is created using the subscribe method, it wonâ€™t receive an event until the next time the next
  method is called. this can be unhelpful if you are creating instances of components or directives dynamically and you
  want them to have some context data as soon as they are created.
</Quote>

### BehaviorSubject

BehaviorSubject class keeps track of the last event it processed and sends it to new subscribers as soon as they call
the subscribe method.

### ReplaySubject

ReplaySubject class does something similar, except that it keeps track of all of its events and sends them all to new
subscribers, allowing them to catch up with any events that were sent before they subscribed.
