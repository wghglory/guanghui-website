## Layered Architecture

Standard layered architecture style includes **presentation layer, business layer, persistence layer and database
layer**.

### Topology

The first variant combines the presentation, business, and persistence layers into a single deployment unit, with the
database layer typically represented as a separate external physical database (or filesystem).

The second variant physically separates the presentation layer into its own deployment unit, with the business and
persistence layers combined into a second deployment unit. Again, with this variant, the database layer is usually
physically separated through an external database or filesystem.

A third variant combines all four standard layers into a single deployment, including the database layer. This variant
might be useful for smaller applications with either an internally embedded database or an in-memory database. Many
on-premises (“on-prem”) products are built and delivered to customers using this third variant.

### Characteristics

This separation of concerns concept within the layered architecture style makes it easy to build effective roles and
responsibility models within the architecture.

This allows developers to leverage their particular technical expertise to focus on the technical aspects of the domain
(such as presentation logic or persistence logic)

The layered architecture is a technically partitioned architecture (as opposed to a domain-partitioned architecture).
Groups of components, rather than being grouped by domain (such as customer), are grouped by their technical role in the
architecture (such as presentation or business). As a result, any particular business domain is spread throughout all of
the layers of the architecture.

Each layer can be either **closed or open**. There are times when it makes sense for certain layers to be open. For
example, suppose there are shared objects within the business layer that contain common functionality for business
components (such as date and string utility classes, auditing classes, logging classes, and so on).

Lack of overall agility (the ability to respond quickly to change)

## Why use this architecture style?

The layered architecture style is a good choice for **small, simple applications or websites**. It is also a good
architecture choice, particularly as a **starting point**, for situations with very **tight budget and time
constraints**. Because of the simplicity and familiarity among developers and architects, the layered architecture is
perhaps one of the lowest-cost architecture styles, promoting ease of development for smaller applications. The layered
architecture style is also a good choice when an architect is still analyzing business needs and requirements and is
unsure which architecture style would be best.

As applications using the layered architecture style grow, characteristics like maintainability, agility, testability,
and deployability are adversely affected. For this reason, large applications and systems using the layered architecture
might be better suited for other, more modular architecture styles.
