excerpt: caveats for template literal types
---

The power in template literals comes when defining a new string based on information inside a type.

Consider the case where a function (`makeWatchedObject`) adds a new function called `on()` to a passed object.

```ts
const passedObject = {
  firstName: 'Saoirse',
  lastName: 'Ronan',
  age: 26,
};
```

What we want to build is a function that has a `on` method that detects each property change event like below:

```ts
const person = makeWatchedObject({
  firstName: 'Saoirse',
  lastName: 'Ronan',
  age: 26,
});

// this is what we want
// makeWatchedObject has added `on` to the anonymous Object
person.on('firstNameChanged', (newValue) => {
  console.log(`firstName was changed to ${newValue}!`); // newValue should have the correct type
});
```

Solution 1:

```ts
type PropEventSource<Type> = {
  on(eventName: `${string & keyof Type}Changed`, callback: (newValue: any) => void): void;
};

// Create a "watched object" with an 'on' method
// so that you can watch for changes to properties.
declare function makeWatchedObject<Type>(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>;
```

With this, we can build something that errors when given the wrong property:

```ts
const person = makeWatchedObject({
  firstName: 'Saoirse',
  lastName: 'Ronan',
  age: 26,
});

person.on('firstNameChanged', () => {});

// Prevent easy human error (using the key instead of the event name)
person.on('firstName', () => {});
// Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'.
```

### Inference with Template Literals

Instead of `any` for newValue, let's make it more specific: we can use a function with a generic such that:

1. The literal used in the first argument is captured as a literal type
2. That literal type can be validated as being in the union of valid attributes in the generic
3. The type of the validated attribute can be looked up in the genericâ€™s structure using Indexed Access
4. This typing information can then be applied to ensure the argument to the callback function is of the same type

Solution 2:

```ts
type PropEventSource<Type> = {
  on<Key extends string & keyof Type>(eventName: `${Key}Changed`, callback: (newValue: Type[Key]) => void): void;
};

declare function makeWatchedObject<Type>(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>;

const person = makeWatchedObject({
  firstName: 'Saoirse',
  lastName: 'Ronan',
  age: 26,
});

person.on('firstNameChanged', (newName) => {
  // (parameter) newName: string
  console.log(`new name is ${newName.toUpperCase()}`);
});

person.on('ageChanged', (newAge) => {
  // (parameter) newAge: number
  if (newAge < 0) {
    console.warn('warning! negative age');
  }
});
```

When a user calls with the string `"firstNameChanged"`, TypeScript will try to infer the right type for `Key`. To do
that, it will match `Key` against the content prior to `"Changed"` and infer the string `"firstName"`. Once TypeScript
figures that out, the `on` method can fetch the type of `firstName` on the original object, which is `string` in this
case. Similarly, when called with `"ageChanged"`, TypeScript finds the type for the property `age` which is `number`.
