excerpt:
  SWR is a great package from Zeit to help make it easier to fetch remote data with hooks. It is based on the
  stale-while-revalidate RFC.

```jsx
function DisplayCrimes({crimes, categories}) {
  const [filterCategory, setFilterCategory] = React.useState(null);
  const filteredCrimes = filterCategory ? crimes.filter((crime) => crime.category === filterCategory) : crimes;

  return (
    <>
      {categories.map((category) => (
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            setFilterCategory(category);
          }}
          key={category}
        >
          {category}
        </button>
      ))}
      {filterCategory && (
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            setFilterCategory(null);
          }}
        >
          reset
        </button>
      )}

      <pre>{JSON.stringify(filteredCrimes, null, 2)}</pre>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Based on my experience with the SWR package, I think it would be my go-to approach when working with RESTful APIs in
React. That said, I don't think I would switch from Apollo if my data were coming from GraphQL. Apollo provides a lot of
nice utilities specific to GraphQL that you wouldn't get with SWR, which admittedly is a lower-level tool that you could
build on top of.
