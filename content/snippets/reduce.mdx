> what is it?

The [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) function of
an `Array` is one of the most versatile functions in JavaScript. With it you can accomplish a lot of the functions from
the [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and
[Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) objects. It's job is to
start with an array, and reduce those elements into some other type of data... which sounds vague, but you could use it
to convert from an array to an object, an array to another array, an array to a number or an array to a boolean.
Understanding how it works opens up a world of possibilities.

```js
function reduce(array, callback, initial) {
  // start our accumulator off as the initial value
  let acc = initial;
  // iterate over each element in the array
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    // pass the accumulator and current element to callback function
    // override the accumulator with the callback's response
    acc = callback(acc, array[i], i);
  }
  // return the final accumulator value
  return acc;
}

result = reduce([1, 2, 3], (acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
```
