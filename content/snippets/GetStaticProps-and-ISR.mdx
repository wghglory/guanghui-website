**Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is
then _reused_ on each request.

```tsx
import {InferGetStaticPropsType} from 'next';

type Post = {
  author: string;
  content: string;
};

// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()
function Blog({posts}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do
// direct database queries. See the "Technical details" section.
export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.
  // You can use any data fetching library
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  };
};

export default Blog;
```

## [When should I use `getStaticProps`?](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#when-should-i-use-getstaticprops)

- The data required to render the page is available at build time ahead of a user’s request.
- The data comes from a headless CMS.
- The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific).
- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — `getStaticProps` generates HTML and JSON files, both of
  which can be cached by a CDN for performance.

## [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration)

```tsx
import {GetStaticPaths, GetStaticProps} from 'next';

function Blog({posts}) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if
// revalidation is enabled and a new request comes in
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:
    // - When a request comes in
    // - At most once every 10 seconds
    revalidate: 10, // In seconds
  };
};

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if
// the path has not been generated.
export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts');
  const posts = await res.json();

  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: {id: post.id},
  }));

  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.
  // { fallback: blocking } will server-render pages
  // on-demand if the path doesn't exist.
  return {paths, fallback: 'blocking'};
};

export default Blog;
```

## Caveats

Note that `getStaticProps` runs only on the server-side. It will never be run on the client-side. It won’t even be
included in the JS bundle for the browser. That means you can write code such as direct database queries without them
being sent to browsers. <u>You should not fetch an **API route** from `getStaticProps` — instead, you can write the
server-side code directly in `getStaticProps`</u>.
