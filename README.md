# My Website

Hello world üëã!

[Welcome to my personal website made with Next.js](https://derekw.vercel.app/). I hosted a quite old one before 2017
using some templates, however, I cannot fully control the UI. Since next.js came to the world, I have been thinking
about creating a modern site to share my thoughts and record my personal working stuff.

My website includes the below aspects:

- Home section introducing me a little bit
- Experience section telling my skills
- Project section listing some projects
- Blog section, as the most important part, where I write posts periodically
- Snippet section sharing some useful snippets

Please leave comments and share you feedbacks! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ù
