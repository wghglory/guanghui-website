# My Website

Hello world! üëã

I'm thrilled to welcome you to my new and improved [personal website crafted with Next.js](https://derekw.netlify.app/).
In the past, I hosted a rather outdated site with generic templates, limiting my control over the user interface.
However, with the advent of Next.js, I've been inspired to create a contemporary space to share my thoughts and document
my professional journey.

Here's a glimpse into the key components of my website:

- **Home Section**: Get to know me a little better.
- **Experience Section**: Explore my skill set and professional background.
- **Project Section**: Check out some of the exciting projects I've been working on.
- **Blog Section**: Dive into the heart of my site, where I regularly share insightful posts.
- **Snippet Section**: Discover and make use of handy code snippets I've curated.

I invite you to explore, leave comments, and share your valuable feedback. Your input is greatly appreciated! Thank you
for visiting! ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ù
